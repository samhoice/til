# Simply Python http server

Strictly speaking I didn't learn this today, but reading https://til.simonwillison.net/ and then encountering this tidbit a little while back inspired this repository (and maybe site at some point). So, with python, run a simple http server with:

`python -m http.server <dir>`
	
where `<dir>` is a directory from which to serve files. http.server can do more but this is a useful bit.
